Travel App Capstone Project

## Overview
This project uses 3 APIs (Geonames, Weatherbit and Pixaby) to provide users with details about any city on a desired date. 

## Instructions
To build the production server, run npm build-prod
To start the express server, run npm start 
To start the development server, run npm run build-dev
To run tests, run npm run test

## Extras
For the special assignment, I used localStorage to allow users to save their data and come back to it on reload. Doing this also had the added benefit of acting as my member-value pair object. :)

# Notes
For this project, I used:
    1. NodeJS & Express
    2. Webpack & SASS
    3. Service Workers
    4. Various APIs
