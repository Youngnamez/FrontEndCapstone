Travel App Capstone Project

## Overview
This project uses 3 APIs (Geonames, Weatherbit and Pixaby) to provide users with details about any city on a desired date. 

## Instructions
To build the production server, run npm build-prod
To start the express server, run npm start 
To start the development server, run npm run build-dev
To run tests, run npm run test

## Extras
For the special assignment, I used localStorage to allow users to save their data and come back to it on reload. Doing this also had the added benefit of acting as my member-value pair object. :)

## Dependencies
This project uses sass-loader, npm, css-loader, style-loader, cors, supertest and many others!

# Notes
For this project, I used:
    1. NodeJS & Express
    2. Webpack & SASS
    3. Service Workers
    4. Various APIs

I've linked different reference sources within the code for places I used assistance, such as from Udacity's site or from StackOverflow.
The bulk of important code here resides in src/client/js/app.js while the server code lives in src/server/index.js.
